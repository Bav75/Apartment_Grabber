# ApartmentGrabber

ApartmentGrabber is a test gem being designed as part of the Flatiron School curriculum. This gem invovles scraping Craiglist for apartment rental listings for educational purposes. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'apartment_grabber'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install apartment_grabber

## Usage

ApartmentGrabber is a command line interface for accessing Craiglist
apartment listings in the San Francisco Bay Area. 

Upon starting up the program, the user will be prompted for their name which will create a new user object. Users will then be prompted to input
their desired specifications for apartments and will receive a prompt asking for how many listings they'd like to see. 

From here, the user has a number of options at their disposal:
- Enter the number of a listing to access additional details 
- help : displays a help message with instructions on accepted inputs 
- list : displays a list of apartments matching your specifications (either a specific # of listings or all listings)
- favorites : displays a list of your favorite apartments
- modify : allows you to modify your search specifications
- users: displays a list of all active users 
- switch: prompts the user to select which user to switch to and restarts ApartmentGrabber
- logout: logs out current user and prompts new user to login
- exit : exits the program


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
